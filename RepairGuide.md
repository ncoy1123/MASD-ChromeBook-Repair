# ChromeBook errors
## Screen Issues
 - If the screen is cracked or similarly damaged
     - The 17, 18,19,20,21 screens all match and are compatible. All screen cables except 17 are also compatible
    1. Remove bezel
    2. unscrew the four screws and take off the screen
    3. The screen will be attached at the bottom with a cable, which will still work. Only the screen its self will have to be removed.
        
- If the screen is having flashing issues, or it doesn't work when the screen is bent, it is a screen cable issue. The screen cable seems to go bad often as it always gets bent with the hinge
    1. The keyboard will have to be removed as well as the bezel and screen as stated above
    2. The cable on the Chromebook side has 2 flaps covering the cable on the top right. The 3 screws on the screen side of the Chromebook hinge also have to be removed.
    3. The screen cable should be able to not be replaced. The screen should work fine.

- if there is a backlight  but the LCD panel is not on it is almost always that the connection is loose on the screen side connector

## Camera Issues
- It's worth a shot to image the Chromebook first. Occasionally a student disables permission for the camera, and imaging also can help with other issues.
- Similarly to the screen cable, the cable breaks due to bending with the hinge. I have a few extra cameras, but it has only been a camera issue a single time.
    - If it does happen to be a camera issue and not a cable issue, it will have to be carefully removed as it is glued in and is connected to a big silver sheet behind the screen. The camera will have to be cut from the silver sheet.
- The keyboard will have to be removed as well as the bezel  will have to be removed, but unlike the screen, there are no screws that need to be undone.
- There are currently 3 types of cables. The 18,19 share one type and the 20 with a smooth lid and with a textured lid both have their own.
    - The 18, 19 camera cable is the widest and the two 20 cables are skinnier. One has a skinny side and one that's a little wider, and the other has 2 skinny sides.
