# ChromeBook Repair
For the process of repairing Chromebooks, it is always a good first step to go through all Chromebooks in the morning and put them in piles based on their issues. Charge any Chromebooks that are listed as having power issue and go through the others, and any that are dead or very low should be charged to them for a few hours. This saves a lot of time by preventing any from dying when being worked on or can help diagnose battery issues.

## Power Issues
#### Battery Issue
Especially after breaks, it seems like a lot of Chromebooks come in as battery issues, but the Chromebooks are just dead, and were not left to charge long enough.  This is partly the importance of charging all the power related Chromebooks first to prevent good batteries from being recycled. 

There are three types of power issues are screen issues, battery issues, and motherboard issues.

For battery issues when the Chromebook is plugged in, typically the charging light will flash, which is the easiest way to know that the power issue is caused by a bad battery. Batteries are all  intercompatible for TESTING, except for 2017 Chromebook batteries. The batteries can be used for testing, but for installation the 18/19 batteries have a different set of mounting holes compared to the 20/21/22. Batteries are the easiest to repair and only require these steps:
1.  Remove the 8 or 6 screws on the back, depending on the model
2.  It is easiest to start right at the Kensington lock and slowly pry up the keyboard
3.  Remove the ribbon cables for the keyboard and the trackpad once the keyboard is up
4.  Unplug the battery connector and remove the 4 screws holding down the battery.

Important notes for battery replacements:
-   Any time the battery is removed, it is important the speaker wires are run properly. If the speaker wires are not ran between the clips on the bottom of the battery like how they are from the factory, this can occasionally cause the trackpad to be unable to click.
-   You should always test the battery by pressing CTRL + ALT + T then typing battery_test. This will by default run a 5-minute test and will tell you how much the battery discharged to the hundredth of a percent. 
-   When doing a battery test if I discharge rate shows zero restart the Chromebook and it should test properly the next time.
-   It's better to look at the discharge rate rather than the battery health during the battery test. The Chromebook batteries are 6, 150 milliamp and battery health is just what it was last fully charged to vs 6,150. Sometimes batteries will be over, 6,150, and it will cause the battery health to be over 100%. Looking at the discharge rate seems to be a better indicator of the battery's actual health. I've run across batteries that the battery health is still above 90%, but it will discharge at a percent and a half or 2% over 5 minutes which is pretty out of the ordinary.
- Typically, I've tried to have the battery discharge rate under 0.8% over the 5-minute test. Sometimes it will be over 0.8%, but if you run the test a second time it is often under.

#### Motherboard Issues
Motherboard issues, are typically pretty straightforward. If you swap out a few batteries, and they don't work, then plug in a mouse and see if the mouse light turns on. If the mouse light does not turn on with any USB port with different batteries, then the motherboard is dead.

If you do the motherboard test and the mouse light comes on then that means it is the display cable that's the issue or rarely the display itself

## Screen Issues
For Chromebook displays, all displays and display cables are intercompatible except for the 2017 Chromebook. The 2017 Chromebook display is intercompatible with any other display, but the cable is not due to it being a combination display cable and the camera cable. 

For a display that was cracked, only the display itself should have to be replaced and the cable in almost all scenarios still works. If the screen is cracked or similarly damaged follow these steps:
    1. Remove bezel
    2. unscrew the four screws and take off the screen
    3. The screen will be attached at the bottom with a cable, which will still work. Only the screen its self will have to be removed and replaced.
        
If a screen cable is bad it has the most variaty in the symtoms which can be: 
-  no image on the display it all
- There is a image on the screen but it is extremely dark(no backlight) 
- The screen will flash but the display panel is not cracked
- The screen does not work when the Chrombook hinge will be bent past a certain point or will just stop at a working at a random point.

The screen cable seems to go bad often as it always gets bent with the hinge. The screen cable can be replaced by following these steps:
1.  Remove the 8 or 6 screws on the back, depending on the model
2.  It is easiest to start right at the Kensington lock and slowly pry up the keyboard
3.  Remove the ribbon cables for the keyboard and the trackpad once the keyboard is up
4. Remove bezel
5. unscrew the four screws and take off the screen
6. on the right side of the chromebook 3 screws on the screen side of the hinge will have to be removed 
7. The cable on the Chromebook side has 2 flaps covering the cable on the top right. 
8. The screen cable loops around and will have to be pulled out and recable mangage that way.

Important notes for screen cable:
- This issue is far less common, but if there is a backlight but the LCD panel is not on, check that the connection is not loose on the screen side connector when removing the screen. For that symptom, the loose connector is almost always the issue.

- Try to put the screen cable back as close to factory as it can be. If not, it can be hard or put the bezel back on or cause interference with the bezel

## Camera Issues
- It's worth a shot to image the Chromebook first. Occasionally a student disables permission for the camera, and imaging also can help with other issues.
- Similarly to the screen cable, the cable breaks due to bending with the hinge. I have a few extra cameras, but it has only been a camera issue a single time.
    - If it does happen to be a camera issue and not a cable issue, it will have to be carefully removed as it is glued in and is connected to a big silver sheet behind the screen. The camera will have to be cut from the silver sheet.
- The keyboard will have to be removed as well as the bezel  will have to be removed, but unlike the screen, there are no screws that need to be undone.
- There are currently 3 types of cables. The 18,19 share one type and the 20 with a smooth lid and with a textured lid both have their own.
    - The 18, 19 camera cable is the widest and the two 20 cables are skinnier. One has a skinny side and one that's a little wider, and the other has 2 skinny sides.







For the process of repairing Chromebooks always good to go through all of them in the morning and put them in piles of the different types of issues  then charge any Chromebooks that are listed as power issue or any device that is dead the first step should be plugging them in and charging them for a few hours. This gives a good idea of which ones are real  power issues and which ones are fine. There are some Chromebooks especially what seems to be in the beginning of the year where they come in as battery issues but the Chromebooks were just dead and they were not left to charge long enough to turn back on. When they're being charged if any of your flashing that typically means it is a battery issue and it will not charge.

There three types of power issues are screen issues, battery issues, and motherboard issues.

For battery issues when you plug them in typically the charging light will flash but not always but batteries are simple fix and with the exception of 2017 batteries all batteries are intercompatible for testing. The batteries are the same connector voltage and size so anyone can be used for testing but to be installed the 18/19 batteries have a different set of mounting holes compared to the 20/21/22. This is typically a easy repair where just swapping the battery will work but there are a couple things to keep in mind

You should always test the battery by pressing control Alt T then typing battery_test. This will by default run a 5-minute test and will tell you how much the battery discharged to the hundredth of a percent. 

When doing a battery test if I discharge rate shows zero restart the Chromebook and it should test properly the next time.

It's better to look at the discharge rate rather than the battery health during the battery test. The Chromebook batteries are 6, 150 milliamp in the battery health is just the last milliamp hours it charge to so sometimes batteries will be over 6150 and it will cause the battery health to be over 100%. Looking at the discharge rate seems to be a better indicator of the battery's actual health. I've ran across batteries that the battery health is still above 90% but it will discharge at a percent and a half or 2% over 5 minutes which is pretty out of the ordinary.

Typically I've tried to have the battery discharge rate under 0.8% over the 5 minute test. Sometimes it will be over 0.8%, but if you run the test a second time it is often under.

  

For the motherboard issues it's typically pretty straightforward. If you swap out a few batteries plug in a mouse and see if the light is on. If with different batteries the mouse light does not turn on with and USB port the motherboard is dead.

  

If you do the motherboard test and if a light on the mouse does come on then that means it is the the display cable that is the issue or rarely the display itself
